# [Introduction to ML using Python and R](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Technologists/events/253578382/)
13 September 2018
Jozi Hub, 44 Stanley

## Details
Python was recently called the fastest growing major programming language by StackOverflow, and its especially influential in data science. Whether its data manipulation with Pandas, creating visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn, or deep learning with TensorFlow, Python seems to have a tool for everything.

But what if you missed the Python train? Its never too late to start! Our third meetup in the series will be intro into Machine Learning Using Python and R!

If you missed our first 2 sessions, don't despair as we will be doing a refresher of what we covered the last time and there will be someone to help if needed!

## ML_slides
These slides are from the `R` portion of the evening's talks.
To view, either open the ML\_slides.html file (which should open in your default internet browser) or open the ML\_slides.pdf file.  Although the pdf file loses all the good gifs.

## Thank you!
I built my slides in R Markdown using [@emitanaka](https://github.com/emitanaka)'s AMAZING **kunoichi-theme** for the [xaringan / remark.js slides](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan).
